        Our gift card sharing platform is dedicated to raising funds for education in Africa. 
        By choosing and sharing our cards, you're contributing to a brighter future for children 
        who lack access to quality education.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Every paid card directly supports our initiatives to build schools, provide learning 
        materials, and train teachers across various African countries. Even our free cards 
        help spread awareness about this important cause.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300">
        Join us in making a difference, one gift card at a time. Together, we can create 
        lasting change and empower the next generation through education.
